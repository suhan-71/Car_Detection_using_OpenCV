Vehicle Detection and Counting Using OpenCV

This Python project detects and counts moving vehicles in a video or webcam feed using OpenCV. The script uses background subtraction and contour detection to identify vehicles, and counts them as they cross a detection line.

Features:

	•	Detects vehicles using background subtraction.
	•	Counts vehicles crossing a defined detection line.
	•	Applies contour detection to track moving objects.
	•	Displays real-time video with bounding boxes around detected vehicles and an updated vehicle count.
